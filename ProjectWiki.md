# Introduction #
This project consists of a java aplication simulating how a dielectric sphere is trapped by a laser beam. At the moment we are still working on the code. The preliminar source code is available via mercurial pull from this site. NetBeans is IDE recommended.

# Libraries #
Two external libraries have been implemented in the project:
**Open Source Physics**: _http://www.compadre.org/osp/webdocs/programming.cfm_
**Apache Commons Mathematics Library**: _http://commons.apache.org/math/_
